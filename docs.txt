Review JS Pacakage Managers, setup up npm, security scanning

- JavaScript Pacakage Managers :

	- Bower.
	- Npm.
	- JSPM.
	- Jam.
	- volo.

- NPM.

	- Install Node and Npm.
	- create package.json and paste it `bit.ly/jsdevpackagejson`
	- install devDependencies.
	- Package security:
		-	node security platform:
			- install node security globally
			- `npm install -g nsp`
			- check if there vulnerability
			- `nsp check`

Review Development Webserver options, config dev webserver,
service for sharing your work

- Development WebServer:

	- http-server.
	- live-server.
	- Express.
	- Budo.
	- Webpack.
	- Browsersync.

- Express:

	- installed as devDependencies.
	- create folder for server and config it.
	- create folder for src code and init it.
	- run node serverfoldername/serverfilename.js

- Sahring Work-in-progress:
	Easily share work on you local machine to customer
	and firends.

	- localtunnel.
	- ngrok.
	- surge.
	- now.

- Automation

	- gulp
	- grunt
	- npm scripts *


- Automation with npm scripts:

	- package.json add to script new script and named start
	and the value `node buildScripts/srcServer.js`.
	- display message with prestart create file and fill it
	and add it to script in package.json file.
	- script for security check

- Tanspiling

	- Babel
	- TypeScript
	- Elm

	-Babel Configuration Styles
	choose between
		- .babelrc
			- not npm specific
			- easier to read since isolated
		- package.json
			- one less file in your project

- Bundling
	- 5 Module Formats

		- IIFE
		- Asynchronous Module Definition
		- CommonJS
		- Universal Module Definition
		- ES6 Modules

	- Why ES6 Modules?

		- Standardized
		- Statically analyzable
		- Easy to read

	- Selecting a Bundler

		- Require.js
		- Browserify
		- Webpack
		- Rollup
		- JSPM

	- Set up Webpack

		- create config file
		- init with server
		- create end point

- Linting
	- Pick a linter

		- jsLint
		- jsHint
		- EsLint

- Testing and Continuous Integration

	- unit testing decisions

		- framework
			- top 6 :

				- Mocha
				- Jasmine
				- Tape
				- QUnit
				- AVA
				- Jest

		- assertion library

			- Whats An Assertion ?
				Declare What you expect
		- helper libraries
		- where to run tests
		- where do place tests
		- when to run tests

	- Continuous Integration

		- why CI ?

			- forgot to commit new file
			- forgot to update package.json
			- commit doesn't run cross-platform
			- node version conflicts
			- bad merge
			- didn't run tests

		- What Does a CI server Do ?

			- Run Automated build
			- Run your tests
			- check code coverage
			- Automate deployment

		CI:
			- Travis *
			- Appveyor *
			- Jenkins
			- Circleci
			- semaphore
			- snapCI
